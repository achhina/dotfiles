	; This is to have better interop between Mac & other OSs. Mac performs
	; unicode decomposition (NFD) when handling unicode filenames. Where as in
	; other OSs output is based on the input, and input is usually NFC. This
	; issue can manifest in re-adding an existing file in git and not having
	; this shown in any diff tools. This came to my attention after running
	; into an issue installing copier via nix, where it's speculated that a
	; file added from a linux distribution was re-added in Mac because of the
	; difference between NFC/NFD output.
